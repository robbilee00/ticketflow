Summary 
I have created a light-weight Service Manager style application. It is designed to help businesses managing customer requests, tickets, and communication. It consists of a web platform that allows staff of a business to enter customer request details and track its status until completion. Each request(ticket) consists of a form with a Ticket Number, status (eg. New, in progress completed), description, raised by, raised on and assignee. An additional section captures attachments and comments for that ticket. 
Tickets will be automatically created when a customer sends an order or request to the businesses email inbox. Any further communication from the customer through email will be added to their open ticket as a new comment. 
Motivation 
I have noticed a problem that some small e-commerce businesses face in trying to organise customersâ€™ orders or requests and keep track of deliverables through email. I aim to fill this gap and make it easier for these businesses to track and complete orders. It will also simplify the process of tracing email trails and associating emails with orders.
